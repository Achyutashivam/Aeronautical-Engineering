          "answer": "Aeronautical Engineering means designing, manufacturing and maintenance of flight machines and aircraft. It is a niche domain which is under development in our country but provides great career opportunities not only in India but in foreign nations also. It also prepares professionals to develop new technologies for the commercial aviation sector. Recruitment opportunities are available in defense services and the aviation industry. Engineering in aeronautics is taxing because of its vast syllabus which requires a lot of dedication and hard work. Know all about- Engineering courses"

          "question": "Which is better: Aeronautical Engineering vs Aerospace Engineering?",
          "answer": "Both Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering are good branches, but if you want to make a choice between one see the difference between them. Aerospace Engineering is a rather more general field of engineering that includes the design, production and use of aircrafts, space crafts and other systems . Aerospace engineers are involved in numerous positions and different fields, whether it be in the designing of a new airplane or the creation of a new propulsion system for a spacecraft. They also deal in the installation of avionic and other systems in aircrafts and space crafts. Aerospace engineers should have a good background knowledge and understanding of mathematics, physics and engineering mechanics, aerodynamics propulsion and thermodynamics. Aeronautical Engineering is slightly more specific than aerospace engineering since it majorly deals with the construction of airplanes. Aeronautical engineers are involved in designing the specials of an aircraft, its controls, structure and power plant. They also must understand the layout of airport and other aviation related structures. Aeronautical engineers normally have a baseline preparation in arithmetic, physics and engineering mechanisms.

          "question": "Do I need prior flying experience for pursuing Aeronautical Engineering?",

The field is about the design and development aspect of aircraft and other flight-worthy vehicles and not the flying aspect per se. Pilot Training courses cover that part in depth. For Aeronautical Engineering courses, a passion for aviation in general and mechanics can be advantageous."

            "answer": "If you have completed Class 12th with PCM subjects and have a minimum score of 50 to 60% in board exams , you are eligible to pursue courses in Aeronautical Engineering after 12th. Also, a keen interest in aviation, aircraft, and understanding how they fly is important for motivation and success in this business field. Problem-solving, creative and analytical skills are also highly valuable in this field. While there is no as such age limit, mostly students are between 17-21 years old when they take admission to UG level Aeronautical Engineering courses. For PG courses in Aeronautical Engg. you must secure at least 50 to 55 percent marks in BTech Aeronautical Engineering or a related field. know more about - Aeronautical Engineering Course Admission"

            "question": "What is the selection process for BTech Aeronautical Engineering course?",
            "answer": "The selection process for the B Tech Aeronautical Engineering course depends on both parameters that include the Class 12 merit and entrance test marks. Most of the Aeronautical Engg. colleges consider the marks obtained by students in relevant entrance tests and then allot a seat on the basis of their rank in the exam. Having said that, there are more than 80 BTech in Aeronautical Engineering colleges that offer merit-based admissions, looking at the Class 12 board exam marks of the students. These colleges mostly take the PI or GD rounds in such cases. Meanwhile, a few colleges also give equal weightage to both the things. So, you should check the guidelines given on the college websites to ensure a smooth admission process."

They're both different specializations - an Aircraft Design Engineer focuses on overall structure and mechanics (body, wings, engines) but an Avionics Engineer works with electronics (radar, navigation, autopilot, communication systems). Candidates should choose Aircraft Design if they love physical, mechanical and also aerodynamic aspects. Or they can choose Avionics if they are interested in computers, electronics and also complex systems that make plane \"smart\"."

In fact, universities provide reservations to women in order to ensure gender equality and attract more female participation in these courses. Furthermore, recruiters such as Air Force and airlines hire more women and are paid at par with their male counterparts. Therefore, female candidates are motivated to pursue BTech in Aeronautical Engineering and contribute to the development of this industry.
